# GTEA HOI

This dataset was originally derived from the [Georgia Tech Egocentric Activity (GTEA) dataset](http://cbs.ic.gatech.edu/fpv/). However it appears their website is now down.

The goals is to add object and interaction annotations to individual frames in the dataset. I.e., bounding boxes and object classes, and annotations for which objects are being acted upon.
